# ESP32-VORBIS-Player
converts (ogg)vorvis into pcm


quick and dirty assembled VORBIS decoder for the ESP32. A Vorbis file (in.ogg) is converted to pcm and saved as out.wav. At the same time, the control signal is played back via I2S. This is not a finished project, but only the basis for your own developments!
